In 2021, NFTs started to gain soaring popularity after the explosive growth of Bitcoin and the subsequent cryptocurrencies over the last couple of years. Cryptocurrencies and NFTs are similar in the sense that their transactions are recorded on a distributed ledger using cryptography, thereby remaining traceable and immutable. However, each NFT is unique and thus has its own distinct value, whereas a unit of cryptocurrencies held by different people is indifferent in terms of value.

> An NFT is "a unique digital certificate, registered in a blockchain, that is used to record the ownership of an asset such as an artwork or a collectible." (from Collins Dictionary)

Such characteristics of NFTs are very well suited to virtual reality (VR) platforms, another emerging digital trend that we can hardly dismiss. From virtual real estate to wearables, a variety of digital assets on VR platforms are created and waiting to be traded.

Since its birth in 2015, Decentraland has been one of the most popular VR platforms paired with NFTs, consisting of 90,601 parcels (named LANDs) and is powered by the Ethereum blockchain.
