In 2021, NFTs started to gain soaring popularity after the explosive growth of Bitcoin and the subsequent cryptocurrencies over the last couple of years. Cryptocurrencies and NFTs are similar in the sense that their transactions are recorded on a distributed ledger using cryptography, thereby remaining traceable and immutable. However, each NFT is unique and can only be held by one owner, whereas cryptocurrencies held by different people are indifferent.

>> An NFT is "a unique digital certificate, registered in a blockchain, that is used to record ownership of an asset such as an artwork or a collectible."

Will people spend more time in Decentraland? Created in 2015, Decentraland has been one of the most popular decentralized virtual reality (VR) platforms, which consists of 90,601 parcels and is powered by the Ethereum blockchain.
