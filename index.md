안녕하세요! Welcome to my blog :-)

I am a PhD student in Information Systems at KAIST College of Business, Seoul. Previously I received a Master's from the same college and a Bachelor's in Industrial and Management Engineering at POSTECH. Spent more than two-thirds of my life in schools, I am still learning who I am and how to create ideas and values for us.

Even though it takes time, I always try my best to be clear and precise, and so does my research. My research explores how the growing cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology can innovate platform businesses by blurring the distinction between investors and users. Platforms today can easily list their own cryptocurrencies on multiple exchanges to be freely trading, and blockchains make all the transactions traceable and immutable. Accordingly, the user demand has grown for earning cryptocurrencies by using products and services based on more transparent information systems. 

Below is a list of ongoing work.
